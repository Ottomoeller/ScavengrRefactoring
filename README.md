ScavengrRefactoring
===================
Scavengr was the Software Design project for UMM CSci 3601 Spring '13, now being used for Refactoring.<br>
It is a web-based photo scavenger hunt tool.<br>
Two main uses:<br>
A goal-oriented photo sharing interface that prompts users to engage in interactive photography.<br>
A way to organize real-world photo scavenger hunts (for teachers, counselors, leaders, etc..)<br><br>
Users can:<br> Create hunts, prompts, and upload photos.<br>
Invite users via email.<br>
Lock-in users (such as children) to a specific hunt.<br><br>
There is not full test coverage yet, but it is something we are working on.
