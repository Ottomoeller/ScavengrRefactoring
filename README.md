ScavengrRefactoring
===================
Scavengr was the Software Design project for UMM CSci 3601 Spring '13.
It is a web-based photo scavenger hunt tool.
Two main uses:
A goal-oriented photo sharing interface that prompts users to engage in interactive photography.
A way to organize real-world photo scavenger hunts (for teachers, counselors, leaders, etc..)
Users can create hunts, prompts, and upload photos.
Invite users via email.
Lock-in users (such as children) to a specific hunt.
